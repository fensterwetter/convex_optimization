This repository contains python solutions as jupyter notebooks for the programming exercises of the Standford Online [Convex Optimization course on edx](https://www.edx.org/course/convex-optimization) by Prof. Stephen Boyd.

The course contains the standard solutions for the exercises only in Matlab. However, the exercises can also be solved using [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/), the python implementation of cvx.
When random data generated by Matlab is needed, I included the generated data in order to obtain the same results as expected in the course.

Unfortunately the notebooks are sometimes not correctly rendered by github. You can use the associated htmls instead or display the notebooks via the [nbviewer online service from jupyter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
