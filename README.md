This repository contains python solutions for the programming exercises of the [Convex Optimization course on edx](https://www.edx.org/course/convex-optimization) in the form of jupyter notebooks.

The course contains the standard solutions for the exercises only in Matlab. However, the exercises can also be solved using [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/), the python implementation of cvx.
When random data generated by Matlab is needed, I included the generated data in order to obtain the same results as expected in the course.
